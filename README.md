# CheckerBot

Code written for an AI checkers tournament in my heuristics class.

The referee folder holds code written by the professor to actually play and referee the tournament.
It also contains copies of the code I wrote "ComputerPlayer" and "ComputerBPlayer".
The same code is also found in the wilsonCheckerBot folder.

ComputerPlayer is the primary cpu I programmed to play in the tournament, with ComputerBPlayer being another
cpu with slightly altered heuristics to test against (as a bot playing against itself only shows so much).

The ComputerPlayer not only won the tournament, but also appeared to operate faster than any of the other bots to boot.
