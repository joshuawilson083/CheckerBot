   * is position i on the board, using the official checkers numbering
   * scheme.  board[i] = -2 for a black king, -1 for a black pawn, 1 for a white pawn,
   * 2 for a white king, and is 0 if the position is unoccupied
   * @param isWhite is true if the player should make a move for White.
   * @param movesRemaining is the number of moves remaining before a draw is called
   *
   * @return First element of the array is the position of the piece to be moved.
   * The remaining elements are subsequent positions to which that piece moves.
   * (There will usually be only one remaining element, unless result encodes a
   * multiple capture/jumping move.)  Thus a move from position 17 to 10, jumping over
   * an opposition piece at position 14 would be encoded via the array: {17, 10}.
   * <b>It is important that the length of the array be exactly 1+ the number of moves
   * made by the piece.</b>
